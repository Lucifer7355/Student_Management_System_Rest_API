# **Student_Management_System_Rest_API**

## I have created this project to learn and demonstrate how distinct entities in real life are related to each other and cardinalities of relation between them. The tools used for the purpose are as follows :-

```
- SpringBoot
- MySQL 
- Lombok
- Spring Data JPA
- app.diagrams.net
- Postman
- Spring Tool Suite 4
```

# The Entity Relation Diagram for the project is as follows:-

Run the project and change the port on which you want server to run from applications.properties files and make request using postman.
